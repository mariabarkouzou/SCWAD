# Instructions For Alan

-When you open this application you will see a microphone button on bottom right corner.

-You can connect your microphone with this application and energise Alan by saying with a clear voice:

"Hello Alan!"

-You can also ask him these questions to help you collect information about the app:

1."How are you?"

2."What does SCWAD stands for Alan?" 

3."What does this application do?" or "What can I do here?" 

4."Can you repeat the steps please?"

5."Why do I need to upload the image of the animal Alan?"

6."Thank you very much" 





####  PS. Although the database connected to ALAN has the 77 biggest cities of Greece , for now ALAN can only hear to some cities due to the accent , so try some of these : 
              ~Athens , Thessaloniki , Preveza , Kalamata , Patra , Volos  , Trikala , Alexandroupoli , Komotini , Katerini , Kavala , Salamina , Tripoli~
